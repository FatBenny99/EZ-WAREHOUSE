# Estimate by size
### 
|             | Estimate                        |             
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |  
| NC =  Estimated number of classes to be developed   |        20                    |             
|  A = Estimated average size per class, in LOC       |         200                   | 
| S = Estimated size of project, in LOC (= NC * A) | 4000 |
| E = Estimated effort, in person hours (here use productivity 10 LOC per person hour)  |                400                      |   
| C = Estimated cost, in euro (here use 1 person hour cost = 30 euro) | 12000 | 
| Estimated calendar time, in calendar weeks (Assume team of 4 people, 8 hours per day, 5 days per week ) |          2.5          |

# Summary

The difference, reguarding the estimated duration, between the first two techniques and the third one comes from the different approch in evaluating the distribution of efforts and resources over the available time, because putting the temporal relationships between the activities on an actual calendar, some activities can overlap and be done in parallel, but counting weekends it enlarges the duration estimation.
Instead, the estimated effort is slightly different because the estimation by activity decomposition is a more detailed analysis of the WBS subactivities and then more person hours are considered with respect to the more general estimation by product, which considers only the deliverables.

|             | Estimated effort                        |   Estimated duration |          
| ----------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------|
| estimate by size |400ph| about 2 weeks
| estimate by product decomposition |370ph| about 2 weeks
| estimate by activity decomposition |400ph| about 3 weeks
